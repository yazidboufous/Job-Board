            <h2> Job Seeker</h2>
            <p> This is the first type of user type and experience.</p>
            Functionalities
            <ul>
                <li>Search and view for jobs</li>
                <li>Search and view for companies</li>
                <li>Apply for jobs</li>
                <li>View/update personal information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can apply filters to search for a variety of different jobs. A button to apply will be provided within
               the display box. Assuming this was an actual job website, the website will apply your information automatically
               so that you can quite literally apply at the click of a button. We are assuming this process has happened and it
               then up to the Recruiter to accept your application. This can also be found on the Jobs page tab.</p>

            <p>Similiar to searching for jobs. The same can be said for companies, expcept you can only search by name.
               I recommend searching 'group' or 'and' to return multiple entries. This can be found in the companies tab.
            </p>

            <p>On the Jobs page tab, you are given the option to apply to any job you deem as fit. This will automatically apply to the job
               where you can then view your applications in the Applied Jobs tab int the user profile tab, marked by an icon.
            </p>

            <p>In the profile tab, you can edit your information as well as view your applied jobs. Clicking information will allow you
                to edit your information.
            </p>

            <h2>Recruiter</h2>
            <p> This is the second type of user type and experience.</p>
            Functionalities
            <ul>
                <li>Post job listings</li>
                <li>View posted job listings</li>
                <li>View applications</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the home page, you can post listings with specific requirements so that they can be viewed by the Job Seekers.
            By pressing post, this will be added to the specific user's jobPostings array so that they can later be viewed under the Posted Jobs
            tab in the user profile.
            </p>

            <p> In the profile section, marked by an icon, you can view/edit your information as well as view your posted jobs and
                applicants. YOu can accept applicants that applied to your listing under this tab. 
            </p>

            <h2>Miscellanious</h2>
            <p> The header is the main form of redirection</p>
